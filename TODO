TO DO
========

* when possible, execute parallel plan fragements in parallel, not linearized

* clean interface (en/de-coding) to planner (e.g. numbers, etc)

* requirements for operations, services
and requirement profiles of planners => dynamic use of planners!

* find a way to figure out the possibly useful services, maybe through relaxed graphs (i.e no precond.)?
  in order to be able to figure out the sum of requirements of these op's
	
* write out ALL objects to the :objects section in problem files -- including those from the fact base!s

* add preprocessing step for ontology alignment
