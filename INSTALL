INSTALLING AND & RUNNING WSPLAN
================================

0. PREREQUISTITES
====================

- Java Development Kit 1.4 or higher
- GNU C++ compatible build environment (e.g. Linux, Windows+CYGWIN)


1. Install Web-VHPOP
=====================

* download Web-VHPOP from http://sourceforge.net/projects/wsplan and extract the package to a folder $VHPOP

* point your command line interpreter to $VHPOP
(Windows users need to use CYGWIN, available for free at http://www.cygwin.com)

run:
./configure
./make
./make install


2. Install WSPlan
===================

* extract the WSPLAN package downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/wsplan to some directory $WSPLAN

3. Configure WSPLAN 
====================

Each scenario has its own configuration file. Among the definitions, the path to the VHPOP startup script is defined in a <planner> element. Edit the definitions in the $WSPLAN/examplex/config-* files to match your configuration:

  <planner name="VHPOP" features="strips, types"  isDefault="true">
    <param name="class" value="org.mcm.sws.planners.VHPOPPlanner"/>
    <!-- change to script on your system -->
    <param name="path" value="d:\cygwin\home\_jpeer\vhpop-2.2\vhpop.bat"/>
    <!-- change to a temp directory on your system -->
    <param name="temp-dir" value="d:\pf\examples\tmp"/>
  </planner>  
  
  
3. Check availability of Web Services 
========================================

either use the publicly available services deployed at 
http://elektra.mcm.unisg.ch:8080/axis

or 

download the WSE (web service example) package from http://sourceforge.net/projects/wsplan and follow the instruction in that package to deploy the services locally. 


4. Run:
===========

there are currently 3 examples which can be run; run them by invoking

$WSPLAN/shopping0.bat
$WSPLAN/shopping1.bat
$WSPLAN/shopping2.bat
 (or *.sh, respectively)
 
wait until the GUI is loaded and the hit the "PLAN" button
